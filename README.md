### Salary Prediction using Decision Trees

### Description:
Salary Prediction using Decision Trees is a machine learning project designed to predict whether an individual's salary exceeds $100k based on factors such as company, job role, and degree. Leveraging the 'salaries.csv' dataset, this project utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier to analyze the features and make predictions regarding salary thresholds.

### Key Features:

- Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and attributes. Preprocessing steps are performed to handle categorical data and ensure data integrity.

- Feature Engineering: Label encoding is applied to convert categorical features such as company, job role, and degree into numerical values, making them suitable for model training.

- Model Training: A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset to create a predictive model. The algorithm learns from the provided features to classify whether a salary exceeds $100k or not.

- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using accuracy metrics to assess its performance in predicting salary thresholds. A score of 1.0 indicates perfect accuracy in this case.

- Prediction: Users can input their desired company, job role, and degree information, and the trained model will predict whether the salary is likely to exceed $100k based on the provided data.
